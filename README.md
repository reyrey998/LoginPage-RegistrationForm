🌟 Project Overview
This Angular application provides a basic user interface for a login and registration flow. The main features include a login page and a registration form that users can access after successful login. The application is designed to be modular, allowing for easy integration of backend services like CAPTCHA verification and JWT authentication.

✨ Features:
🔐 Login Page: A basic form for users to log in.
📝 Registration Page: A form for new users to register their details.

🔄 Routing: After logging in, users are navigated to the registration page.

📝 Notes
This project is set up to showcase the UI components and navigation flow. However, certain backend integrations, such as CAPTCHA verification and JWT authentication, have been omitted for this demonstration. If these were implemented with real APIs, the login and registration forms would function fully, with secure authentication and CAPTCHA protection.

💡 What to Expect:
🚫 No Backend Integration: The login form does not authenticate against a server, and the CAPTCHA is not validated.
🌐 Navigation: You can manually navigate to /registrationpage to view the registration form.
👀 View-Only Mode: The forms are fully functional from a UI perspective, but no data is processed or stored.

🎮 Try It Out:
Open the application and navigate to the login page.
You can view the login form, but it will not authenticate.
To view the registration form, navigate directly to /registrationpage.
